  And I'm just a Software Engineer who's worked on various cool B2B products. Previously, I worked at startups such as Shypple and Tablecheck.

  Some technologies I enjoy working with include <strong>Ruby/Rails</strong>, <strong>Golang</strong> and <strong>Rust</strong> <i>(of course, this list could be infinite)</i>. I am a big fan of open-source software, and I am always open to open-source ideas and offers. My libs were downloaded more than 230k times, and I am proud of that. (Sadly I suspect a lot of these downloads were from bots and crawlers).

  I am a big fan of disruptive startups, great wines, crypto investing, and ambitious minds.
