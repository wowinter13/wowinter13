  I’m a Software Engineer who’s worked on various cool B2B products. Previously, I contributed to startups like Shypple and Tablecheck.

Currenly developing:
- [`OpenCryptoList.xyz`](https://opencryptolist.xyz/?ref=github) – to help new developers interested in the blockchain industry make their first contributions to blockchain-related projects.
- [`solvitor.xyz`](https://solvitor.xyz/?ref=github) – to get IDL info from closed-source Solana programs (an AI-based reverse engineering tool)
- [`ShareSpeak.co`](https://sharespeak.co/?ref=github) – an AI-powered invisible teleprompter made for screencasters.
- [`IndexMachine.co`](https://indexmachine.co/?ref=github) – to get your website indexed by Google, Bing, ChatGPT, X, and other search engines. Drive more SEO traffic. (WIP)

  Some technologies I enjoy working with include <strong>Ruby/Rails</strong>, <strong>Golang</strong>, and <strong>Rust</strong> <i>(of course, this list could be infinite)</i>. I’m a big fan of open-source software and always open to ideas and offers in that space. My libraries have been downloaded over 260k times, and I’m proud of that (though I suspect many of those downloads were from bots and crawlers).
</p>

My OSS work revolves around building utility-focused libraries and tools:
 - [🔓`pkcs12cracker`](https://github.com/wowinter13/pkcs12cracker) – A simple tool to concurrently attack password-protected PKCS#12 (PFX/P12) files
 - [💬`telegrama-rs`](https://github.com/wowinter13/telegrama-rs) – Send admin notifications as Telegram messages (shoutout to @rameerez)

 - [📊`finance_rb`](https://github.com/wowinter13/finance_rb) – A ruby port of numpy-financial functions
 - [🟣🔎`solscan-mcp`](https://github.com/wowinter13/solscan-mcp) – An MCP server for querying Solana transactions using natural language with Solscan API
- [🖼️🔓`visual-cryptography`](https://github.com/wowinter13/visual-cryptography) – An experimental repository with implementations of all basic visual cryptography schemes
