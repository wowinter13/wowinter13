# Hi, I'm Vlad 👋🏻 👨🏼‍💻

<p align="left">
  I’m a Software Engineer who’s worked on various cool B2B products. Previously, I contributed to startups like Shypple and Tablecheck.

  Some technologies I enjoy working with include <strong>Ruby/Rails</strong>, <strong>Golang</strong>, and <strong>Rust</strong> <i>(of course, this list could be infinite)</i>. I’m a big fan of open-source software and always open to ideas and offers in that space. My libraries have been downloaded over 230k times, and I’m proud of that (though I suspect many of those downloads were from bots and crawlers).
</p>

My OSS work revolves around building utility-focused libraries and tools:
 - [🔓 `pkcs12cracker`](https://github.com/wowinter13/pkcs12cracker) – A simple tool to concurrently attack password-protected PKCS#12 (PFX/P12) files
 - [💬 `telegrama-rs`](https://github.com/wowinter13/telegrama-rs) – Send admin notifications as Telegram messages (shoutout to @rameerez)
 - [🇬🇧⚙️ `english-to-cron`](https://github.com/wowinter13/english-to-cron) – Converts natural language into cron expressions

  I’m a big fan of disruptive startups, great wines, crypto investing, and ambitious minds.
